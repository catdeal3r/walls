# Walls

This is my personal collection of wallpapers from across the internet. None of these photos or artworks are owned by me.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an owner of a photograph or art piece that is in here, feel free to create an issue to have you credited or the photograph/artwork taken down.

There will be a preview readme in every folder, generated by a script which I haven't made yet.
