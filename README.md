# Walls

This is my personal collection of wallpapers from across the internet. None of these photos or artworks are owned by me.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an owner of a photograph or art piece that is in here, feel free to create an issue to have you credited or the photograph/artwork taken down.

There is a preview readme in every folder, generated by a [script which I have made](https://github.com/dealerofallthecats/walls/blob/main/generate.sh).
